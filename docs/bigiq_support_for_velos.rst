BIG-IQ Support for VELOS
========================

Currently VELOS support in BIG-IQ will mimic VIPRION functionality. In VIPRION a vCMP guest can be created via the chassis CLI, webUI, or API and it can then be imported into BIG-IQ as a device. From there statistics/analytics can be gathered, and L4-7 configurations can be managed in a variety of ways. A VELOS tenant will behave identical to a vCMP guest from a BIG-IQ perspective, meaning you can import it after it has been created to manage configuration or get analytics.

When a VELOS tenant is created it can be imported as a device into BIG-IQ. It will import just like any other BIG-IP instance or device.  Once imported it will show up with a Type of **BIG-IP Tenant**.

VELOS tenants can also be onboarded in BIG-IQ using Declarative Onboarding (DO). Once A tenant is created via one of the VELOS interfaces you can run a DO declaration like the one below to BIG-IQ to provision, configure and import it. In the DO declaration you will specify a **targetHost** which is the IP address of the tenant to be onboarded. The following is an example of a DO declaration for onboarding a VELOS tenant:

.. code-block:: bash

    POST https://{{BigIQ_Mgmt}}/mgmt/shared/declarative-onboarding

            },
            "snapshotWorkingConfig": false
        }
    }

Shortly after the declaration is sent to BIG-IQ you can see a new onboarding task. This will take a while to complete as it may require reboots of the tenant for module provisioning. After the tenant is onboarded it will be imported into BIG-IQ.
