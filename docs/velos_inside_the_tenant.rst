Inside the Tenant
=================

Once a tenant is deployed you can connect/communicate directly to one of its CLI, GUI, or API interfaces. At this layer you are interacting with TMOS, i.e. the experience should be almost identical to a vCMP guest with some minor exceptions.

VLAN Behavior
=============

In VIRPION with vCMP, VLANs are created at the vCMP host layer and added to physical interfaces or trunks. The VLANs are then assigned to a vCMP guest at creation time using the VLAN name. VLAN names are passed through to the vCMP guest as-is, meaning the names are unaltered. 

VELOS follows a similar behavior as far as tenants inheriting VLANs from the F5OS layer. At tenant creation time the admin will assign VLANs to the tenant based on VLAN ID. In VIPRION a vCMP guest will inherit the VLAN names, and they will appear inside the tenant. The initial versions of VELOS passed VLAN IDâ€™s to the tenant but not the name (names were autogenerated), but as of F5OS version 1.1.2 the VELOS tenant will inherit the VLAN names just as a vCMP guest will. Below is a VELOS tenant showing the VLAN names being passed from the F5OS layer that the tenant was configured for:
